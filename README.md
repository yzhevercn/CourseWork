# CourseWork

my course coding homework.

Percolation: Algorithms, Part I, week1 (with 100 points!:). Backwash problem solved by using 2 UF objects.

Queues: Algorithms, Part I, week2 (with 100 points!:). Implement list for Deque and array for RandomizedQueue. A simple idea was used to reach the timing requirement.


Take it as you like!
