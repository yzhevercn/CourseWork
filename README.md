# CourseWork

my course coding homework.

Percolation: Algorithms, Part 1, week1 (with 100 points). Backwash problem solved by using 2 UF objects.

Queues: Algorithms, Part 1, week2 (with 100 points). Implement list for Deque and array for RandomizedQueue. A simple idea was used to reach the timing requirement.

Collinear: Algorithms, Part 1, week3 (with 97 points. = =). Find all collinear points in a part of random/given points. Some timing requirements are not reached:(

8puzzle: Algorithms, Part 1, week4 (with 100 points). Solve 8-puzzle problem by priority queue. Iterable node was used to output the final solve path. I've also leart how to override comparator and iterator.

KdTrees: Algorithms, Part 1, week5 (with 100 points). Implement a 2d-tree to reach geometric requirements. Including contain(), range(), insert() and nearest(). Reduce timing requirment from o(N) to o(lgN + R).

WordNet: Algorithms, Part 2, week1 (with 100 points). Construct the wordnet with a digraph. BFS is the key to implement most methods.

SeamCarving: Algorithms, Part 2, week2 (with 100 points and 3 bouns). Resizing an RGB image according its energy. Key words: Shortest path, digraph, topological sort, image. Take care of column and row index and define distTo[] and edgeTo[] as local veriable.
