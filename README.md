# CourseWork

my course coding homework.

Percolation: Algorithms, Part I, week1 (with 100 points!:). Backwash problem solved by using 2 UF objects.

Queues: Algorithms, Part I, week2 (with 100 points!:). Implement list for Deque and array for RandomizedQueue. A simple idea was used to reach the timing requirement.

Collinear: Algorithms, Part I, week3 (with 97 points. = =). Find all collinear points in a part of random/given points. Some timing requirements are not reached:(

8puzzle: Algorithms, Part I, week4 (with 100 points). Solve 8-puzzle problem by priority queue. Iterable node was used to output the final solve path. I've also leart how to override comparator and iterator.

Take it as you like!
